TODO's That Need To Be Worked On
================================

*If you use json tags on a model (client side, or anywhere really) to make the 
names lowercase; ToStruct() doesn't work. This is because I am not checking
anything out about struct tags when marshalling back from a map to a struct.

*Query methods, both string searching on disk, and key/value filtering.

*Add GetAllDocuments() method that returns a Docs type (type Docs []Doc) which
implements sorting methods on Doc.Id.
