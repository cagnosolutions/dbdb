TODO's That Need To Be Worked On
================================
*Query methods, both string searching on disk, and key/value filtering.
*Possibly add ART (Adaptive Radix Tree) indexes to database
*Add unit tests for rpc client and server


*** finish network event loop
*** status "ping"
*** lexer and paser need fully implemented into server side func
*** db.GetAll() --> {"store":[{doc-data}, {docd-ata}...]}
*** db.Flush() --> wipes entire database. consider dumping a backup tar before doing this action.
